I wanted to shared some Vim tips that I use regularly that are built-in, so
there you don't need to touch your `vimrc`.

# Pressing escape

Pressing escape on most keyboards can be awkward and people have come up with
different solutions to make this better. I have been using `CTRL-[` for a while
now and I really like it.

# Reindent line

Sometimes the indentation of the line I'm editing from insert mode is
incorrect, rather than leaving insert mode and fixing the indentation in
command mode, you can use `i_CTRL-F` and Vim will reindent the current line.

# Deleting indent

This is useful when editing Python code, as an example:

```python
def f(x, y):
  if x and y:
    print('yes')
```

if I'm at the end of the `print` statement and I press enter, Vim will place me
on the next line with the same indent. However, if I was done implementing this
function and wanted to write a new function I can use `i_0_CTRL-D` and Vim will
delete all indentation in the current line.
