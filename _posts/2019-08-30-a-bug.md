In this post I would like to show you a bug that caught me out. I think it's an
interesting bug, because at first I couldn't see any problems with what I was
doing even though I was aware of the optimization that was causing me problems.

The following code snippet is a simplified example of the bug I encountered.

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<std::string> strings;
    strings.emplace_back("Hi");
    const char* c_str = strings[0].c_str();
    strings.emplace_back("Ciao");
    assert(c_str == strings[0].c_str());
}
```

The problem here is if `std::string` is using the Small String Optimization,
the first string I added to the vector isn't allocated on the heap, it's tied
to the memory allocated by the vector, once the vector needs to reallocate, the
pointer I saved is no longer pointing to the correct location. Once I attempted
to make use of my saved pointer, the program would crash.
